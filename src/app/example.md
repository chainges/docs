## CALLOUT type="warning"

{% callout type="warning" title="Oh no! Something bad happened!" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}

## CODE

```js
// cache-advance.config.js
export default {
  strategy: 'predictive',
  engine: {
    cpus: 12,
    backups: ['./storage/cache.wtf'],
  },
}
```

## CALLOUT

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
