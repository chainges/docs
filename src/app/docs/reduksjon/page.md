## Reduksjonseksempler

Klimarapportering handler om å finne ut **hvor du er**, for så å legge en plan for å komme **dit du ønsker**. Så når vi har utgangspunktet så kan vi iverksette tiltak for å komme frem. Her er noen forslag til tiltak, hentet fra GHG-protokollen, som kan iverksettes for å redusere utslipp innen de åtte scope 3 oppstrømskategoriene.

- ## Category
- ## Actions to Reduce Scope 3 Emissions

---

- 1. **Purchased goods and services**
- - Replace high-GHG-emitting raw materials with low-GHG-emitting raw materials
  - Implement low-GHG-procurement/purchasing policies
  - Encourage tier 1 suppliers to engage their tier 1 suppliers (i.e., the reporting company’s tier 2 suppliers) and disclose these scope 3 emissions to the customer in order to propagate GHG reporting throughout the supply chain

---

- 2. **Capital goods**
- - Replace high-GHG-emitting capital goods with low-GHG-emitting capital goods (i.e., from suppliers with low emitting production and/or local suppliers.)

---

- 3. **Fuel- and energy-related activities**
- - Reduce energy consumption
  - Change energy source (e.g., shift toward lower-emitting fuel/energy sources)
  - Generate energy on site using renewable sources

---

- 4. **Upstream transportation and distribution**
- - Reduce distance between supplier and customer
  - Source materials locally if it leads to net GHG reductions
  - Optimize efficiency of transportation and distribution
  - Replace higher-emitting transportation modes (e.g. air transport) with lower-emitting transportation modes (e.g. marine transport)
  - Shift toward lower-emitting fuel sources

---

- 5. **Waste generated in operations**
- - Reduce quantity of waste generated in operations
  - Implement recycling measures that lead to net GHG reductions
  - Implement lower-emitting waste treatment methods

---

- 6. **Business travel**
- - Reduce the amount of business travel (e.g., encourage video conferencing and web-based meetings as an alternative to in-person meetings)
  - Encourage more efficient travel
  - Encourage lower-emitting modes of travel (e.g., rail instead of plane)

---

- 7. **Employee commuting**
- - Reduce commuting distance (e.g., locate offices/facilities near urban centers and public transit facilities)
  - Create disincentives for commuting by car (e.g., parking policies)
  - Provide incentives for use of public transit, bicycling, carpooling, etc.
  - Implement teleworking/telecommuting programs
  - Reduce the number of days worked per week (e.g., 4 days x 10-hour schedule instead of 5 days x 8-hour schedule)

---

- 8. **Upstream leased assets**
- - Increase energy efficiency of operations
  - Shift toward lower-emitting fuel sources
